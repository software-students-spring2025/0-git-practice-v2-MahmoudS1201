I enjoyed this article because it takes a concept of physical manufacturing, *Lean Manufacturing*, to digital manufacturing which we can call *Lean Development*.
Lean Manufacturing is meant to minimize waste, and although we may not think of minimizing *waste* in the traditional in our software, we can learn to avoid inefficient code which is waste in it's own right.
I most liked the focus on the importance of omptimizing the whole rather than individual tasks. 
All in all, this article shows a smarter, more efficient, approach to developing software which balances speed and efficiency.

I wonder what principle developers struggle the most with. From what I gathered from the article, it seems "optimizing the whole" is the one most struggle with.
